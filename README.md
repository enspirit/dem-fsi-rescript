# Doc-e-mate, your document's best friend

This repository holds the file system interface library of the ReScript version
of Doc-e-mate, a tool that allows you to generate and print documents written in
Markdown, styled in CSS, with business data injected from JSON or YAML files.

This is a split of the https://github.com/enspirit/dem-rescript project,
in order to remove unwanted dependencies between the modules of the tool.
